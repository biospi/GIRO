# GIRO
Groupwise Image Registration and nOrmalisation: 

In shotgun LCMS proteomical experiment, it is well known that the retention time of different 
chromatography runs may vary. Moreover the quantitation of the peptide may also vary. GIRO provides
two functions: retention time alignment and abundance normalisation.  

GIRO is a novel signal processing based method for LCMS retention time adjustment. It takes every
LCMS samples as an image, and by applying groupwise image registration, it aligns the retention time
of all LCMS images into the same coordinate system so that the RT drift can be recovered in Silico. 
Moreover, the abundance normalisation is performed after RT alignment, which is also essential towards
a more accurate quantitation outcome.
